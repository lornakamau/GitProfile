# GitHubProfile
#### A clone of GitHub's profile page , 27/05/2021.
#### By Lorna Kamau

## Description
A clone of GitHub's profile page. One can search for a user's profile and repositories by entering the username in the search field located in the navbar.  No CSS or JS frameworks were used in the development of this application.
While every other page functionality and style was cloned, the following features were left out:
1. Overview, Packages and Projects tabs
2. Graph showing year of activity for the repository
3. Pagination of repositories (only the first 20 are loaded)
